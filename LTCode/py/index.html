    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p>
      In Python, to declare a variable you just need to give variable a name and
      value:
    </p>
    <code><i>variable_name</i> = <i>value</i></code>
    <p>
      Variable name can be anything (e.g. a, b, name, age). It can contain upper
      and lower letters, numbers and underscore character. But, it can't start
      with number. You can name variable like a, b or c, but it isn't
      recommended. Because, when you read your code that you wrote 1 or 2 years
      ago, it will be hard to understand what the code does and which variable
      is used for what. It is good practice to give variable a meaningful and
      suitable name. So:
    </p>
    <code>
      a = <i>value</i> #Error won't occur, but not recommended <br />
      name = <i>value</i> #Error won't occur and good code <br />
      1stchoice = <i>value</i> #Good naming, but error will occur, it is better
      to name it first_choice <br />
      1 = <i>value</i> #Error will occur and bad code
    </code>
  </body>
